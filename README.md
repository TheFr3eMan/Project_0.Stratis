# Project_0.Stratis

## What is it?
It is a mission for ARMA III. The goal of this project is to make a guerrilla warfare simulator for ARMA III, hugely influenced by a similar mission by Barbolani: Antistasi (http://www.a3antistasi.enjin.com/).

## Goals of this project
* Most of the features of the original Antistasi.
* Proper operation of logistics of the enemy and friendly factions, including handling of all units, i.e. no areas generating infinite amounts of enemies.
* Implement high level AI easier to control by player and more responsive to actions of enemy side.

## Current state of development
Currently the following components are fully or partially implemented:
* Main system components
* Enhanced logistics framework by Jeroen Not (enhanced arsenal, enhanced garage, enhanced repairing, rearming, refueling, etc.)
* HC management
* Garrison caching of locations
* GOAP AI framework

## Technical implementation
* Most of the code is being developed with OOP-Light (https://github.com/Sparker95/OOP-Light), a custom OOP implementation for SQF.
OOP paradigm should help produce manageable code and help implement complex systems.
* AI is being handled by a custom GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) AI framework. GOAP is a technology which was first used in fameous F.E.A.R. first person shooter. GOAP should help manage the complexity of creation of complex AI behaviours that involve replannable chains of actions.
